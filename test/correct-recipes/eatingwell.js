Easy Chicken Cacciatore 

Ingredients

    • ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
    • 2 pounds chicken thighs and/or drumsticks, skinned (8 pieces)
    • ¼ teaspoon kosher salt or sea salt
    • ⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    • 2 tablespoons olive oil
    • 4 small carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into thirds
    • 3 stalks celery, cut crosswise into quarters
    • 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
    • 8 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
    • ¼ cup tomato paste
    • 1 cup reduced sodium chicken broth
    • 1 cup dry red wine or cranberry juice
    • 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
    • 6 medium plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped
    • 1 tablespoon snipped fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
    • 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
    • 2 tablespoons snipped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Instructions

    1) Spread flour in a shallow dish. Season chicken pieces with the salt and pepper. Dip chicken in the flour, turning to coat evenly and gently shaking off excess.
    2) In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces; cook about 6 minutes or until browned, turning occasionally.
    3) Remove chicken from Dutch oven; set aside. Drain off fat, reserving 2 tablespoons in the Dutch oven. Add carrots, celery, onion, and garlic. Cook about 5 minutes or just until onion is tender, stirring occasionally.
    4) Stir in tomato paste. Add broth, wine, and vinegar; bring to boiling. Add tomatoes and thyme. Return chicken to Dutch oven. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, covered, for 60 to 70 minutes or until chicken and vegetables are tender.
    5) To serve, place chicken, vegetables, and cooking juices on a serving platter. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley.`
