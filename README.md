# Recipe-Scraper

-------General info-------

The core of a potentially far more ambitious recipe-scraping website. Currently, it is just a single page that you can feed a url, and it will give you back the title, ingredients, and instructions as plaintext. Someday, perhaps featuring accounts, permanent storage of scraped recipes, tags, the ability to download them as individual files or in batches, and the ability to share recipes or collections.

Also perhaps someday featuring support for more websites.
